Rules of Life Database
- Negentropy sustains life
- All living things must grow
- Must avoid extinction (e.g., sterility, inviability) resulting from hybridization of long lived organisms
- Use recombination to get rid of bad mutations from a population
- Adapt to a predicted environment
- Teach cells how to avoid death similar to how vaccines work

Observations
- Older people have more experience and accumulation of mutations and diseases (In order to get younger, does the body need to unlearn certain unwanted information?)

Algorithm

Environment Prediction System

Genome Database
- genes and non-coding (aka "junk") in RNA/DNA

Family History Database
- The relative utility of genetic testing or family history in predicting disease varies among common diseases.

Individual Classification System

Questions/Answers for Artificial Intelligence (example: IBM Watson)
- How do immortals adapt to a changing environment?
- How do immortals diverge from mortals?
