Evolution
=========

"If you are interested in the evolution of a particular gene or gene family it is often intetesting to examine the intro-exon structure even across species. Often, the only data available is the mRNA sequence from a cDNA or a curated database such as refseq. Is it possible, however, to see how the mRNA aligns to genomic sequence using BLAST and thus arrive at an idea of its possible intron exon structure." -- http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastTips#3
