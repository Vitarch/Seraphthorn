My hypothesis is that we need to manipulate the energy from Mitochondria using computer algorithms and testing environment for longevity.  My guess is that it is a complicated algorithm.  :)


"mitochondria are responsible for the production of cellular energy by generating ATP through the electron transport chain (ETC) located on the inner mitochondrial membrane" -- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3468885/

My hypothesis is that clones share the same soul.

Experiment proposal:
- Collect data about decisions made by cloned, short lived animals in a controlled, identical environment.
- If the cloned animals make the same decisions in an identical environment, the probability is good that my hypothesis is correct.
