* It’s a tidy, self-governing system, and it’s tempting to call it ubiquitous. 
But these studies have revealed too that not everything has a clock. Embryonic stem cells, 
which can develop into almost any cell type, don’t keep time. The testes, almost alone among the organs that have been tested, 
don’t seem to have a clock either. 
And many cancer cells do not keep a regular rhythm. What could these things have in common? 
This is where Partch’s discovery comes in.

* why would some types of cells lack a clock or have a weakened one?

The appearance of circadian proteins is a step function in the stem cells, it is a kind of source function. At other places it is a slow rythmic function rising to peak and then falling (may be a sinusoid). If it is a kind of sinusoid does it mean some kind of Biological Fourier Transform is working here? Also disturbunce to it causes noise like variations which can be taken just as noise in electronics.
Can a variable or some kind of threshold be introduced just like signal to noise ratio that increases and ultimately masks the clock? Very interesting analogy between engineering and biology.

If you haven't already, please look at the work of Norbert Weiner, a professor at CCNY and MIT. He investigate the synchronization of millions of independent clocks.

He did this work in the 1940s.

Question: What is the frame of reference for our clocks?
