Cancer risk in a procedure called "laparoscopic power morcellation".  Fibroids should be removed whole.



REFERENCE
=========
"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning women and doctors about the risks of a certain technique used in surgery for 
uterine fibroids. The procedure, called laparoscopic power morcellation, uses a medical device to break uterine fibroids into small pieces,
so they can be removed through a small incision in the abdomen. According to the FDA, if the woman also has uterine cancer, 
this procedure can risk spreading the cancer within the abdomen and pelvis, making it harder to treat." --
