>90% caused by environnmental toxins and 
< 5-10% cause by a defective gene

"A fraction of all cases of familial ALS (that is, inherited ALS) is believed to be caused by a defective gene 
that prevents the body from producing a normal amount of an enzyme called superoxide dismutase. 
This enzyme helps neutralize free radicals -- highly reactive oxygen molecules produced during metabolism and 
capable of damaging body tissues. Researchers speculate that defects in protective enzymes may also account for 
non-inherited ALS and that environmental toxins may be a factor." -- http://www.webmd.com/brain/understanding-als-basics
