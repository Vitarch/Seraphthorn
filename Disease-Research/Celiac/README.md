Someone who had late onset Celiac mentioned that she got it after she had a terrible reaction to poison ivy.
The infection was so bad that she had to take antibiotics where she was hospitalized.  She took another medication (steroids) so there was a medicinal cocktail and other factors that could've contributed to the onset of gluten sensitive enteropathy.

I have another friend who was diagnosed with Celiac after the birth of her second child (a daughter).  Her first child was a boy.  It's possible this friend had an epidural steroid injection.

Celiac Disease is hereditary.  From these 2 samples, I see a pattern of external triggers that involved extreme stress.  The other possibility includes what was in the medications.

My conclusion is that Antibiotics + Steroids + Infection played a role in the trigger where Steroids is key.
