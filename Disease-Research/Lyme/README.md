TODO
====
* Systematic data collection of unique users (based on email / IP address kept anonymous) of 
  - symptoms  
  - treatments
  - response to treatments
  - diagnosis
  -   bacteria
  -   virus
  - DNA results
  - user biological profile
  - user environment
  - dates

Implementation in Mongo, Express, Angular, Node.JS 
Plans for backend in Python.

Users would be able to update their information.  Changes would be tracked by dates.  Users would be notified how their changes affect the data analysis.

Research
========
* Nano-robots to locate and target the Lyme bacteria 

Diagnostics
===========
* Low white blood cell count
    - Low Neutrophil

Treatments
==========
* Most important is Good hygiene (e.g., wash hands, keep clean, practice food safety) because of weak immune system
* Diet: Quality proteins and fresh whole foods (organic vegetables and fruit).  See Registered Dietitian.
