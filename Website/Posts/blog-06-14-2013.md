One day, my daughter asked me what is my most favorite thing in the world, my favorite color, my favorite food.  I wondered where this was going but she never said a word until Mother’s Day.  She pleasantly surprised me with the best Mother's Day present in the world with a beautiful scarf she weaved herself with all my favorite things especially crystalized snow.  It brought tears to my eyes how happy she makes me.  The scarf sparkled in the sunlight.

This idea of favorite things made me wonder what draws me to crystalized snow.  Could I be attracted to crystalized snow because therein lies the answer?  Could there be a correlation between what I am compelled to accomplish and what attracts me in nature?   Recognizing this fact is a good place to start looking.

The kind of snow I’m referring to is snow that is transformed from a varying shift of temperatures.  I found these words to describe what I’m referring to.  I can’t say for certain the legitimacy of this website which claims 100 words for snow by Inuits but here are the words that describe somewhat the kind of snow I'm talking about:

kripya          snow that has melted and refrozen
slimtla         snow that is crusted on top but soft underneath
semtla          partially melted snow
sotla           snow sparkling with sunlight
Another description is like sugar snow (not exactly but some of the qualities of sugar snow apply):

Sugar snow



What are some of your favorites things? + What do you hope to accomplish? = ANSWER
