As people grow older past the prime age of 25 years old, the body starts to wear down.  People tend to eat less and exercise more to stay healthy.  But why does it seem like the healthy thing to do?  I have a theory that:

We need to burn more energy in a useful way as we grow older to live longer.

Burning energy for the sake of burning energy such as running on a treadmill may fool others and yourself into thinking you are healthy but it's all a veneer.  We kind of already know this because no one approves of anyone spending too much time at the gym.  Alternatively, it is also not socially acceptable to be lazy.  Everyone needs to serve a purpose.  Life in its simplest form obeys this basic principle: "use it or lose it"

This "gut instinct" explains our rooted understanding about life.  It's very possible it will take an incredible amount of energy to make someone immortal.  In order to become immortal, the amount of energy you must burn could be cubic with time.

Basically, your body stops growing taller and somewhat bigger so you have to do more to make up for that energy not being spent on growing.  In order to live, your body needs to grow.  Burning brighter and hotter over time is analogous to a star like a Blue supergiant.

Hold on there!  Fast burning stars don't last very long.  Shouldn't we all move slowly, eat less, do nothing to live longer like the slow burning stars?  No because that is not living.  That is not life.

So how can immortality be achieved for life to grow indefinitely, serve a purpose, and consume unlimited resources without exploding into chaos like a supernova?  How do you break a law to become immortal and follow other laws that will support immortality? What's great about life on earth is our ability to communicate, control space and time.  The answer is on the cusp.  The cyclic model of the universe could support the theory that individuals could be immortal.  Hey Watson, a little help here! ;)

"Anyone who is physically capable of activity should try to “reach at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week and have around 20 to 30 minutes of that be vigorous activity,” says Klaus Gebel, a senior research fellow at James Cook University in Cairns, Australia, who led the second study. And a larger dose, for those who are so inclined, does not seem to be unsafe, he said." -- http://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8QH64.html?articleId=1&WT.mc_id=2016-CPLTEST-FB-MC8-10
