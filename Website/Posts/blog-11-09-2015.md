This past weekend, I attended a design sprint hosted by Team X NYC.  I worked with a team of rock star scientists who all happen to be affiliated with NYU.  We ultimately pitched the idea of using nanobot cream patches for skin and breast cancer ...

But really Nanobots can be used for any type of diseases such as Lyme Disease.  Nano-bots are tiny mobile robots made of genetic materials that can penetrate cells, identify and destroy targeted viruses and bacteria.

One of the challenges of late stage Lyme Disease is targeting the Lyme Disease bacteria.  These bacteria are very good at hiding from the body's immune system.  That's where Nanobots could be an effective treatment because current cancer treatments such as immunotherapy would not work on Lyme Disease.  This technology already exists as an effective treatment for Hepatitis C.  Similar techniques should work for Lyme Disease.
