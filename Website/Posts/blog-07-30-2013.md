“What greater wealth is there than to own your life and to spend it on growing? Every living thing must grow. It can't stand still. It must grow or perish.”
― Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged



I've never quite understood college physics in the late 1990's.  One of the things in physics that confounded me was mass: "What is mass?"  I somehow managed to get my head out of the clouds long enough to graduate (barely) by blindly accepting mass to be either matter or weight.  Apparently, mass has different definitions depending on if mass is at rest or in motion; then there's special relativistic and general relativistic mass and much much more (Just Google "mass").  The m in E=mc² refers to special relativistic mass.  Most undergrad classical physics refers to mass at rest.

So what does this all mean?  In classical physics education, the distinctions of mass can be safely ignored by the layman.  Whereas in quantum mechanics, the distinctions of mass cannot be ignored since we're talking here about manipulating mass in order to achieve immortality for individual human beings.  The other point I'd like to make regarding quantum mechanics' relationship to immortality is that I think aging can be manipulated simply by manipulating a formula involving the aging rate in relativity.

"The quantities that a moving observer measures as scaled by γ in special relativity are not confined to mass.  Two others commonly encountered in the subject are a body's length in the direction of motion and its ageing rate, both of which get reduced by a factor of γ when measured by a passing observer.  So, a ruler has a rest length, being the length it was given on the production line, and a relativistic or contracted length in the direction of its motion, which is the length we measure it to have as it moves past us.  Likewise, a stationary clock ages normally, but when it moves it ages slowly by the gamma factor (so that its "factory tick rate" is reduced by γ).  Lastly, an object has a rest mass, being the mass it "came off the production line with", and a relativistic mass, being defined as above.  When at rest, the object's rest mass equals its relativistic mass.  When it moves, its acceleration is determined by both its relativistic mass (or its rest mass, of course) and its velocity."  --  http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/mass.html

Think about life in terms of the heat death of the universe.  Life reproduce life like an oscillating spring that is dampening.  Individual humans don't necessarily need to reproduce and then die.  Individual humans should be able to survive until the heat death of the universe or even better survive beyond the heat death of the universe by one day escaping this universe when that time comes for the universe to end.

For starters, it's important to understand Quantum Mechanics.  The Laws of the very small are very different from the Laws of the relatively large.  You can learn about the 3 well known phenomena (superposition, entanglement, collapse) of Quantum Systems by playing quantum tic-tac-toe:

Life depends on motion.  Gravity and other forces acting on life that began somehow (Big Bang theory) is perpetuating life through these forces that help generate heat.  A rock put into motion will not become alive because it didn't have life to begin with.  Just like people need to be fed all the time to live, people need to be in motion at all times.  Even when a person is sleeping, the person is in motion.

Question: Does some DNA or RNA or something in the human body stop being in motion just before death by aging?  Is it even possible for any body to be at rest?  What is the cosmological life cycle of an individual?  What causes individual death by aging?

We know that excessive radiation causes cancer when DNA gets denatured.  We know that people can survive in outer space for a relatively extended period of time where there is very little gravity.  We know that there are some life forms on earth that are almost immortal.  We know that the Human Body obeys the Laws of Thermodynamics (All things decay).  We know that Quantum Mechanics is real.  We know that teleportation is possible using quantum mechanics.  We know that Life is programmable.

One possibility to explore is the science behind teleportation which may allow people to live forever.  Rather than messy surgical organ replacements to extend human life, an entire human body can be recreated on the other end of a teleportation station.  My guess is that even if we achieved teleportation, the science behind immortality will need some tweaking since the arrow of time could still be moving forward regardless of the matter's position in space.

Google recently announced the creation of a new subsidiary company Calico which will solve the mystery of death.  With the backing of Google's information, manpower and wealth, the answer is within our grasp.
