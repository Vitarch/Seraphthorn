1.     Be Kind

Respect and be kind to yourself, others and the environment.  A Centenarian from Okinawa named Kamada’s secret to longevity is to be kind to people:

“Eat your vegetables, have a positive outlook, be kind to people, and smile”. – The Blue Zones by Dan Buttner. 

Life does not exist in a vacuum.  Enabling a good support system is vital.

2.     Serve a Purpose – Use It or Lose It

Look at the life of bacteria: Micro-organisms must serve a purpose to survive.

3.     Adapt

See Darwin and Lamarckism for more information.

4.     Learn Something New all the time

Unwilling to learn something new all the time is the new illiteracy.

5.     Reduce risks

Take advantage of reliable sources of information to make rational decisions to minimize risks.

6.     Go with the Flow (most of the time)

On the CBS hit show Survivor, the ultimate survivor was Sandra Diaz-Twine.  On the show, she stayed true to herself and followed the group's consensus.

7.     Eat and Live Healthy

If you’re older and live a sedentary lifestyle then it’s healthier for you to consume fewer calories than when you were younger.  Also, living an active lifestyle is important to staying relevant (see #2: Use It or Lose It).

8.     Get Involved

Help make this world a better place.

9.     Strive for Quality of Life

Be positive.  Enjoy each and every precious moment.

10.  Maximize your Time

Manage your time efficiently to gain more experiences.
