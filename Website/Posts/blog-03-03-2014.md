Uploading memory is not a way to achieve physical immortality.  Capturing the mind on a computer is analogous to filming an actor in a movie.  The actor is immortal in the movie in a sense because the person appears ageless when viewed by an observer but the actual actor/person is mortal.

I hope the message is not lost from Erwin Schr√∂dinger's discovery that "life is programmable" to mean something other than that biological life is programmable by biological design.  Uploading memory into computers have other practical applications but in terms of physical immortality, life being programmable is about redesigning humans using the computer as a tool.

Basically, in order to become physically immortal you need to become redesigned.  How? This is a work in progress.  Stay tuned for the physical immortality algorithm.
